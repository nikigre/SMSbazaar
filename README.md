# SMS bazaar
**Important! This project was bodget together just to make it work**
## Quick background and description
SMS bazaar was an SMS like auction site where users could reserve homemade masks, decoration and advent wreath. Every year students of our school make lots of items from scratch and are sold on a charity fair for school fund to raise money for students in need. But this year was different. Because of Coronavirus, all schools were closed, so this event would not be possible to realise. So we decided to have an online fair. But how?
We got the idea that users could reserve items that they like. We decided to use a phone number. It is unique and good enough for our purposes. The user could go to the school website and choose the item he desired from the available ones. After that, they just send an SMS with the item number to the listed phone number and the item will be reserved.
